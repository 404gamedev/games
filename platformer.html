            <p><strong>About the Game:</strong> Theres nothing interesting about this game its just there and as the name suggests its a trial version of the full version it only has one level which definetly sucks and has some nasty glitches. So as an advice from me dont play this game. (Just for information this was the first game i made my self without any help, I did made some before but i used some help in them.)</p>
            <p><strong>Controls:</strong> Arrow keys or if you are a true gamer WASD to move.</p>
            <p><strong>COPYRIGHT:</strong>Keep in mind this game file contains assets i downloaded fro free though i am not sure if i am allowd to use assets or not but for credits the player assets are taken from a youtuber named DevJeeper</p>

            <p><strong>Download Instructions:</strong>Ounce you download the file you will end up with a zip file named Platformer.zip just extract it and run the game.exe file it should run the game.</p>
            <P>You might see a pop up from windows firewall but nothing to fear this happens because this game does not have a recognised certificate as in onrder to get one we are supposed to pay some fee and i dont have any just allow the program to run. </P>
